 E-Commerce Sector

---

## Objective of the Project
The primary objective of this project is to analyze customer behaviour in the context of online shopping. By exploring various aspects such as demographics, shopping habits, device usage, and preferences for different e-commerce platforms, we aim to uncover patterns and insights that can help in understanding the evolving trends in online shopping.

## Steps Executed
1. **Data Cleaning**: Ensuring data quality by handling missing values, correcting data types, and renaming columns for clarity.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing key variables' distributions, identifying trends, and exploring relationships between variables.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Using statistical tests like chi-square to understand the significance of observed patterns.
4. **Customer Segmentation**: Employing clustering techniques to categorize customers based on their responses.
5. **Modelling**: Building predictive models to understand customer behaviour and preferences.

## Why This Project is Useful
This analysis provides valuable insights into customer preferences and behaviour in the e-commerce domain. It can help businesses tailor their strategies, improve customer engagement, and enhance the overall shopping experience.

## Key Results and Insights
- Significant correlation between customer demographics and their shopping frequency.
- Predominant use of mobile devices and specific operating systems for online shopping.
- Clear preferences for certain payment options and e-commerce platforms among different demographic groups.
- The effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting customer behaviour based on historical data.

## Getting Started with the Project
